# Skill-Specific Evaluation Dimensions (S1–S3)

Detailed scoring rubrics for dimensions that apply only when evaluating SKILL.md files.

---

## Tool vs Skill

| Concept | Essence | Function | Example |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Tool** | What model CAN do | Execute actions | bash, read_file, write_file, WebSearch |
| **Skill** | What model KNOWS how to do | Guide decisions | PDF processing, MCP building, frontend design |

**The equation**: `General Agent + Excellent Skill = Domain Expert Agent`

## S1: Specification Compliance — Especially Description (15 points)

**MANDATORY — Load the agentskills spec from `references/agentskills-spec.md` before scoring this dimension.** Score against the spec, not baked-in knowledge — requirements may have changed.

Does the Skill follow official format requirements? **Special focus on description quality.**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–5 | Missing frontmatter or invalid format |
| 6–10 | Has frontmatter but description is vague or incomplete |
| 11–13 | Valid frontmatter, description has WHAT but weak on WHEN |
| 14–15 | Perfect: comprehensive description with WHAT, WHEN, and trigger keywords |

**Why description is THE MOST IMPORTANT field**:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL ACTIVATION FLOW                                              │
│                                                                     │
│  User Request → Agent sees ALL skill descriptions → Decides which  │
│                 (only descriptions, not bodies!)     to activate    │
│                                                                     │
│  If description doesn't match → Skill NEVER gets loaded            │
│  If description is vague → Skill might not trigger when it should  │
│  If description lacks keywords → Skill is invisible to the Agent   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Description must answer THREE questions**:

1. **WHAT**: What does this Skill do? (functionality)
2. **WHEN**: In what situations should it be used? (trigger scenarios)
3. **KEYWORDS**: What terms should trigger this Skill? (searchable terms)

**Description quality checklist**:

- [ ] Lists specific capabilities (not just "helps with X")
- [ ] Includes explicit trigger scenarios ("Use when...", "When user asks for...")
- [ ] Contains searchable keywords (file extensions, domain terms, action verbs)
- [ ] Specific enough that Agent knows EXACTLY when to use it
- [ ] Single-line value — no YAML multiline (`|` or `>`) present; if multiline, deduct S1 to 0–5 range
- [ ] Max 1024 chars (count it; over-length is a spec violation regardless of content quality)
- [ ] No colons in the description value (unescaped colons break frontmatter — auto-fail S1 if present)
- [ ] **Third-person imperative** — description must not contain "I", "me", "my", "we", "our", "you", "your"; first/second-person degrades discovery. Fail S1 to 6–10 range if present.
- [ ] **Negative triggers present** — description includes "Don't use for…"; absence is not an auto-fail but deduct 1pt from S1 if missing entirely.
- [ ] **Reaches for coverage, not only precision** — the common failure is a skill that never fires, not one that fires too often. A description scoped so narrowly that it only matches its own title is under-triggering; deduct 1pt. Descriptions that name adjacent phrasings and unspoken intents ("even when the user doesn't say X") score higher, provided a negative trigger bounds the reach.
- [ ] **States trigger conditions, not a workflow summary** — a description that narrates the steps gets acted on directly and the agent never opens the body. Deduct 1pt when the description reads as a procedure rather than a set of conditions.
- [ ] **Combined cap** — `description` + `when_to_use` must total ≤1,536 chars; past that the listing is silently truncated and the tail triggers never load. Over-length is a spec violation regardless of content quality.
- [ ] **No dated model ID** anywhere in frontmatter (`claude-*-YYYYMMDD`) — deduct 1pt; these are deprecated on a schedule the skill does not control.

**Do not penalize a description** for failing to trigger on a trivial, one-step prompt. The model consults a skill only for tasks it can't comfortably handle alone, so a simple request may not activate any skill regardless of how well the description matches. That is a property of the routing mechanism, not a description defect.
- [ ] **Trigger validation** (recommended): write one should-trigger prompt and confirm the skill activates in a live session — description quality is untestable by rubric alone. Use `ai-forge-eval` to validate behaviorally if uncertain.
- [ ] **Directory compliance**: no non-SKILL.md files at skill root — docs in `references/`, executables in `scripts/`, data/templates in `assets/`. Any root-level stray file is a spec violation; deduct S1 to 6–10 range.

## S2: Progressive Disclosure (15 points)

Does the Skill implement proper content layering?

Skill loading has three layers:

```text
Layer 1: Metadata (always in memory)
         Only name + description
         ~100 tokens per skill

Layer 2: SKILL.md Body (loaded after triggering)
         Detailed guidelines, code examples, decision trees
         Ideal: < 200 lines

Layer 3: Resources (loaded on demand)
         references/, scripts/, assets/
         No limit
```

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–5 | Everything dumped in SKILL.md (>200 lines, no structure) |
| 6–10 | Has references but unclear when to load them |
| 11–13 | Good layering with MANDATORY triggers present |
| 14–15 | Perfect: decision trees + explicit triggers + "Do NOT Load" guidance |

**For Skills WITH references directory**, check Loading Trigger Quality:

| Trigger Quality | Characteristics |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Poor | References listed at end, no loading guidance |
| Mediocre | Some triggers but not embedded in workflow |
| Good | MANDATORY triggers in workflow steps |
| Excellent | Scenario detection + conditional triggers + "Do NOT Load" guidance |

**Additional S2 checks**:

- **References depth**: all references are 1 level from `SKILL.md` (no `SKILL.md → a.md → b.md` chains). Each chain link → deduct 2pts from S2.
- **TOC for long references**: reference files > 300 lines must have a table of contents at the top. Absence → deduct 1pt per file.
- **No `<details>` blocks**: collapsing is a rendering affordance for humans — an agent receives the full expanded text and pays full token cost, so a `<details>` block is not progressive disclosure. Each one → deduct 2pts from S2, and note the content belongs in `references/`.

**For simple Skills** (no references, <100 lines): Score based on conciseness and self-containment.

## S3: Pattern Recognition (10 points)

Does the Skill follow an established pattern?

| Pattern | ~Lines | Key Characteristics | When to Use |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Mindset** | ~50 | Thinking > technique, strong NEVER list, high freedom | Creative tasks requiring taste |
| **Navigation** | ~30 | Minimal SKILL.md, routes to sub-files | Multiple distinct scenarios |
| **Philosophy** | ~150 | Two-step: Philosophy → Express, emphasizes craft | Art/creation requiring originality |
| **Process** | ~200 | Phased workflow, checkpoints, medium freedom | Complex multi-step projects |
| **Tool** | ~300 | Decision trees, code examples, low freedom | Precise operations on specific formats |

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–3 | No recognizable pattern, chaotic structure |
| 4–6 | Partially follows a pattern with significant deviations |
| 7–8 | Clear pattern with minor deviations |
| 9–10 | Masterful application of appropriate pattern |

**The meta-question**: Would an expert in this domain, looking at this Skill, say:
> "Yes, this captures knowledge that took me years to learn"?
